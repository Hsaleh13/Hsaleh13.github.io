Frameworks:
* Frameworks are code that has already been written. 
* This pre written code allows us to build our own custom application. 
* Frameworks give wb developers a basic standard website, in which they can add on to and quickly build their own site. 
* Frameworks are often referenced as batteries. 
* The battery defintion is when the framework had high level integrations. 
				* Examples is Django (which is opinionated). 
				* Another example is flask which is not battery included (high customization).

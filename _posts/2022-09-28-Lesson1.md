***Git***
* Git is a type of version control system that allows us to be able to take snapshots. 
* Git also tracks changes that we make. 
* Git also allows people to work together on a project. 
* Some common commands that are used in Git are: 
			* Git add (adds a file) 
			*  Git push (pushes the commit)
			* Git commit (changes in code) 
			* Git branch (snapshot of the code)
			* Git rm (is a command to reove a file) 

**Github**
* A repository can hold files, images, and sheets. 
* Any of the saved changes on the file is called commits. 
* You can use the github site to input files and then have the Git desktop to commit those changes.
